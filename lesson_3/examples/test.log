LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages:

Faster training speed and higher efficiency
Lower memory usage
Better accuracy
Parallel and GPU learning supported
Capable of handling large-scale data
For more details, please refer to Features. Benefit from these advantages, LightGBM is being widely-used in many winning solutions of machine learning competitions.

Comparison experiments on public datasets show that LightGBM can outperform existing boosting frameworks on both efficiency and accuracy, with significantly lower memory consumption. What's more, the parallel experiments show that LightGBM can achieve a linear speed-up by using multiple machines for training in specific settings.
